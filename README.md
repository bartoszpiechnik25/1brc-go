# 1 Bilion Rows Challenge - Go

This repository contains the solution for the 1 Bilion Rows Challenge in Go with table cositing of progress I've made every single iteration along with the commit hash so I can easily see the previous versions of the code.

All of the test were done on my personal computer with the following specs:

- CPU: Intel Core i7-8700K @ 4.8 GHz

- RAM: 16 GB DDR4 3200 MHz

- OS: Ubuntu 22.04

Approach | Execution Time | Difference | Commit Hash
--- | --- | --- | ---
Naive approach. Simply read the file line by line, add to hash map and collect cities names, in the end build result string and output it to the file | 3m17,392s | - | -
